  "description": "SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C and\nC++ libraries. SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The\ncode generator processes a set of specification files and generates C or\nC++ code which is then compiled to create the bindings extension module.\nThe SIP Python module provides support functions to the automatically\ngenerated code.\n",
